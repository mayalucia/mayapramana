* Introduction

MāyāPramāṇa is designed as a universal quantum sensor controller ---
a grammar for feedback, estimation, and calibration that applies
across sensor types. The manifesto motivates this through atomic
magnetometry and NV-diamond sensing. This document maps the broader
landscape of applications, with neuroscience and medicine as the
central thread.

The argument is structural, not analogical: the same physics, the
same mathematics, the same control problems recur across domains.
A digital twin built for one sensor type teaches us about others ---
Dignāga's upamāna, learning by structural comparison.

* Quantum Magnetometry for Brain Imaging

** The MEG Revolution

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures the magnetic fields produced by
neuronal currents --- primarily the synchronised postsynaptic
potentials of tens of thousands of pyramidal neurons arranged in
cortical columns. These fields are extraordinarily weak: 50--500
femtotesla at the scalp, against a background of the Earth's field
(~50 microtesla) and urban electromagnetic noise.

For decades, MEG required cryogenic SQUID sensors cooled to 4 K in
liquid helium, housed in magnetically shielded rooms costing millions.
The sensors were fixed in a rigid helmet, requiring the subject to
sit motionless. This limited MEG to well-funded research centres and
excluded entire populations (young children, patients with movement
disorders) from study.

The revolution is /optically pumped magnetometers/ (OPMs). These are
alkali-vapor magnetometers --- the same technology Saikat works with
--- miniaturised into sensor modules that:

- Operate at room temperature (or mildly heated, ~150°C cell)
- Can be placed directly on the scalp (millimetres from the cortex,
  vs ~3 cm standoff for cryogenic systems)
- Allow flexible, wearable arrays that move with the subject
- Achieve sensitivities of 10--15 fT/√Hz, approaching SQUID
  performance

The physics is identical to the atomic magnetometer digital twin in
MāyāPramāṇa's first lessons: optical pumping creates spin
polarisation, the magnetic field causes Larmor precession, and the
precession is read out optically. The Bloch equations govern the
dynamics. The same feedback loops (field zeroing, laser frequency
locking) appear.

** What a Universal Controller Offers MEG

A wearable OPM-MEG system is not just a magnetometer array. It is
a /distributed quantum sensing system/ with specific control
challenges:

- *Cross-talk compensation*: each OPM generates its own magnetic
  field (the bias field); in a dense array, sensors perturb each
  other. The controller must model and cancel these interactions
  in real time.
- *Background field cancellation*: without a heavily shielded room,
  the Earth's field and its gradients must be actively cancelled
  using coil arrays. This is a multi-channel feedback problem ---
  estimate the background field, compute the cancellation currents,
  actuate the coils, verify the residual.
- *Motion correction*: if the subject moves, the sensor array moves
  through the background field gradient. The controller must
  distinguish brain signals from motion artifacts, using
  co-registered accelerometers and reference magnetometers.
- *Adaptive bandwidth*: different neural signals occupy different
  frequency bands (delta: 1--4 Hz, theta: 4--8 Hz, alpha: 8--13 Hz,
  beta: 13--30 Hz, gamma: 30--100+ Hz). The controller should
  optimise sensitivity for the band of interest.

Every one of these is a problem expressible in MāyāPramāṇa's
grammar: state estimation (Kalman filters, particle filters), feedback
(PID, model-predictive control), noise modelling (spectral analysis,
Allan variance), and signal separation (beamforming, ICA as
post-processing informed by sensor models).

** Source Localisation and the Inverse Problem

The /forward problem/ in MEG is well-posed: given a current dipole at
a known location in the brain, compute the magnetic field at each
sensor. This requires a conductor model (the head) and Maxwell's
equations.

The /inverse problem/ is ill-posed: given the sensor measurements,
infer the source distribution. There are infinitely many source
configurations that produce the same external field (the
non-uniqueness of the magnetic inverse problem).

The digital twin of the sensor array is a critical input to the
inverse problem. The accuracy of source localisation depends on
knowing exactly how each sensor responds --- its orientation, its
gain, its frequency response, its noise floor, its cross-talk with
neighbours. A digital twin that can be validated against bench
measurements provides this calibration.

The Fisher information matrix of the sensor array --- the same Fisher
information that appears in the Cramér-Rao bound for a single
magnetometer --- determines the theoretical resolution limit of the
array for source localisation. MāyāPramāṇa's information-theoretic
framework applies directly.

* Magnetocardiography

The heart produces magnetic fields roughly a thousand times stronger
than the brain (~50 picotesla at the chest surface), making it
accessible to less sensitive magnetometers. Magnetocardiography (MCG)
offers:

- *Non-contact measurement*: no electrodes, no skin preparation, can
  measure through clothing
- *Complementary information to ECG*: the magnetic field is less
  distorted by tissue conductivity variations than the electric
  potential, providing cleaner spatial information about cardiac
  current sources
- *Fetal MCG*: non-invasive assessment of fetal cardiac rhythm,
  arrhythmia detection, where electrodes cannot reach

The same OPM sensors used for MEG can be repurposed for MCG with
different array geometry and different signal processing. The
controller grammar is identical. The noise environment differs
(the chest moves with respiration; the heart's field is quasi-periodic
and can be signal-averaged), requiring adapted estimation strategies
--- but the same Kalman filter structure, the same spectral analysis
tools.

A portable MCG system using OPMs could bring cardiac magnetic imaging
to the point of care --- a screening tool in a general practitioner's
office, a monitoring device in a rural clinic, a diagnostic aid where
ECG is insufficient.

* NV-Diamond Sensors: Toward Cellular Resolution

Nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond are solid-state quantum sensors
that can operate at room temperature and --- critically --- can be
fabricated at nanometre scales. A single NV centre is a single-spin
magnetometer.

For biomedical applications, this opens possibilities that bulk
magnetometers cannot reach:

- *Single-neuron magnetometry*: an NV-diamond chip placed against
  neural tissue could detect the magnetic field of individual action
  potentials (~1 nanotesla at micrometre distances). This has been
  demonstrated in proof-of-concept with worm ganglia.
- *Intracellular sensing*: nanodiamonds containing NV centres can be
  introduced into living cells, sensing local magnetic fields,
  temperature, and strain.
- *Label-free molecular detection*: NV magnetometers can detect the
  nuclear magnetic resonance of nanolitre sample volumes, enabling
  chemical analysis without fluorescent labels.

The physics differs from alkali-vapor sensors (solid-state spin
Hamiltonian, optically detected magnetic resonance, different
noise sources), but the control structure is the same: initialise
the spin state (laser pulse), interrogate (microwave pulse sequence),
read out (photoluminescence), estimate the field, repeat. The
digital twin of an NV sensor uses different Hamiltonians but the same
controller grammar.

* Ultra-Low-Field MRI

Conventional MRI uses superconducting magnets (1.5--7 T) that cost
millions and weigh tonnes. Ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI operates at
microtesla fields, where:

- The Larmor frequency drops into the audio range (~2 kHz at 50 μT)
- SQUID or OPM sensors replace the induction coils used at high field
- The scanner can be lightweight, portable, and inexpensive

The physics of ULF-MRI is /the same Bloch equations/ that govern an
atomic magnetometer. The T₁ and T₂ relaxation times, the precession
dynamics, the pulse sequence design --- all appear in MāyāPramāṇa's
lesson 00. The digital twin of a ULF-MRI system is, in a precise
sense, the digital twin of a magnetometer with a structured sample.

ULF-MRI combined with MEG (using the same sensor array for both)
is an active area of research: a single instrument that provides
both functional (MEG) and structural (MRI) brain imaging, without
cryogenics, without superconducting magnets, portable enough for
a rural clinic.

The controller challenges are formidable: pulse sequence optimisation,
encoding gradient design, image reconstruction from sparse, noisy
data --- all expressible in the language of estimation, feedback, and
information.

* Biomagnetism and Regenerative Medicine

Beyond brain and heart, biological magnetic fields arise from:

- *Peripheral nerve conduction*: the magnetic field of an action
  potential propagating along a peripheral nerve can be detected with
  sensitive magnetometers, offering non-invasive neurography
- *Muscle activity*: magnetomyography (MMG) --- the magnetic
  counterpart of electromyography --- provides spatially resolved
  information about muscle fibre recruitment
- *Wound currents*: injured tissue generates ionic currents
  (the "current of injury") that produce detectable magnetic fields;
  tracking these fields could monitor wound healing non-invasively
- *Bone growth*: piezoelectric effects in bone under mechanical stress
  generate magnetic fields that correlate with osteogenic activity

These signals are weak and the biology is complex, but the sensor
physics and control challenges are variations on the same themes.
A universal controller that can be configured for different sensor
types, different noise environments, and different signal
characteristics enables exploration of these frontiers without
rebuilding the control stack from scratch.

* Quantum Sensing for Point-of-Care Diagnostics

The convergence of miniaturised quantum sensors, FPGA-based digital
controllers, and machine learning for signal processing creates the
possibility of portable diagnostic devices:

- *Portable MEG*: helmet-based OPM systems for bedside or ambulance
  use --- detecting strokes, seizures, traumatic brain injury in the
  field
- *Portable MCG*: cardiac screening without ECG electrodes, suitable
  for mass screening programmes
- *NV-diamond biosensors*: chip-scale NMR for blood chemistry, drug
  levels, biomarker detection at the point of care
- *Quantum-enhanced pulse oximetry*: precision measurement of blood
  oxygenation using quantum sensing modalities

The bottleneck is not the sensors. The sensor physics is advancing
rapidly. The bottleneck is the /control and calibration/ --- the
firmware, the feedback loops, the estimation algorithms, the noise
rejection. This is precisely what a universal controller addresses.

* The Pedagogical Dimension

#+begin_quote
The best way to learn is to teach; the best way to teach is to build.
#+end_quote

The structural parallels across these applications create a unique
pedagogical opportunity. A course built around MāyāPramāṇa can teach:

| Physics | Through |
|---------|---------|
| Bloch equations | Atomic magnetometer /and/ NMR/MRI |
| Spin dynamics | Alkali vapors /and/ NV centres |
| Feedback control | Laser locking /and/ field cancellation |
| Kalman filtering | Magnetometer drift /and/ neural state estimation |
| Fisher information | Sensor sensitivity /and/ source localisation |
| Noise analysis | Shot noise /and/ biological artifact rejection |

A student who builds a digital twin of an atomic magnetometer and
then sees the /same/ Bloch equations reappear in an MRI pulse
sequence has learned something deeper than either topic alone. The
universal controller is not just a tool --- it is a /curriculum/,
organised around the unity of measurement physics.

This connects directly to MāyāLucIA's broader pedagogical vision:
understanding through creation, verified manuscripts, the Feynman
imperative. The digital twin is both the teaching tool and the
assessment --- if the model works, the student understands.

* From Here

The applications listed here are not a roadmap. They are a landscape.
MāyāPramāṇa will begin where the physics is clearest and the
collaborator is at hand --- Saikat's atomic magnetometers. But the
grammar we build should be written with awareness that the same
words will be spoken in neuroscience clinics, in cardiology wards,
in portable diagnostic kits, in classrooms where the Bloch equations
come alive as a magnetometer simulation rather than a homework
problem.

The digital twin does not know what it is measuring. That is its
strength.
